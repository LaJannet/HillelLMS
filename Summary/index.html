<h1>Eileen L.</h1>
<p>Eileen's passion for design is rivaled only by her love for the industry.
She drives the strategy and creativity for Alpha Creative, conducting
detailed market research on developing and implementing new
advertising plans and designs for all businesses. Known for breaking
down the wall between the business direction and design strategy.
With the natural gift of God, she had a pair of Creative Eyes and
+ Sharp-witted brain, and she has been named the "Magician" ever
since.
Managed the tightest budgets, monitored and analysed social media
accounts, determined the best type of ads for the target audience,
and assisted in developing a new rebranding strategy. She always
believes that when there's a want, there's a way. The fundamental is
about knowing what the final goal is.
She is convinced that businesses should build relationships with
their alias, partners, or clients. It is never about creating or building a
"business" for business.</p>
